# Play! - Compatibility Tracker

This is the official Play! compatibility tracker. Based on the same concept for cxbx: https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/game-compatibility.

Still a work in progress. All information from the wiki (https://github.com/jpd002/Play-/wiki/Compatible-games) will be migrated here.

# Game statuses

**state-playable** means that the game is fully playable.

**state-ingame** means somewhat playable past title screens (including with graphics bugs, crashes, and other major problems).

**state-intro** means nothing but an intro/opening of the game is shown (such as a video/animation/company name/etc.).

**state-loadable** means that the game is capable of being read but can't actually start/run yet.

**state-nothing** means that the game won't even be read by the emulator and/or crashes the emulator before the game even gets to show much of anything.
